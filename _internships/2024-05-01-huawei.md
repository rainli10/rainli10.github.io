highlights:
  - Research on enhancement and refinement of relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting
  - Develpoed an algorithm called UniGaussian that integrated fisheye and pinhole camera models for 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction in autonomous driving scenarios via Unified Gaussian Representations
  - Developed a novel single-image–to–3D reconstruction pipeline to address fine-detail loss in diffusion-based 3D asset generation.
  - Participated in simulating on group's end-to-end pipeline for autonomous driving
