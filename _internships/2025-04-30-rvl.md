highlights:
  - Developed a sparse view 4D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm for use in real-world robot tasks that achieved superior reconstruction quality under minimal camera setups, cutting the number of input views needed for reconstruction from ∼20 to ∼4. This work will be integrated into the group’s adversarial study on iterative-policy-learning.
