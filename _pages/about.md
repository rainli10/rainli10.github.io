I am a final year undergraduate Engineering Science Student at University of Toronto, major in Robotics Engineering. I'm working with Professor [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander) in [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab (TRAIL)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) for undergraduate thesis.

I worked as student researcher at [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) with Professor [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) and been 12-month Co-op on Autonomous Driving team at [Noah's Ark Lab Canada](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/).

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am actively seeking a PhD position in Computer Vision & Robotics in North America for Fall 2026!</span>

Research Interest
======
My research spans **computer vision, robotics, and machine learning**, with a focus on developing systems that bridge **visual understanding and real-world interaction**. I am particularly interested in enabling machines to see, reason, and act in complex environments.

Beyond Research
======
Beyond research, I am the co-founder of **SkyFlow Robotics**, a startup developing **autonomous drone and robotic platforms** for precision agriculture and turf management. My work integrates fundamental AI methods with applied robotics, with the goal of creating systems that are scientifically rigorous, socially impactful, and practically deployable.

Fun Fact
======
I enjoy spending time with my boy Kuma, a playful **Alaskan Malamute** who is turning two years old.
