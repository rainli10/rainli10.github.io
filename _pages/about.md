Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Robotics Engineering. I am currently conducting my undergraduate thesis research in long-horizon Vision-Language Navigation under Professor Professor [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander) in [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab (TRAIL)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/). Previously, I worked as student researcher at [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) with Professor [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) on Sparse-view 4D Gaussian Splatting. I also completed a 12-month co-op as Researcher at [Noah's Ark Lab Canada](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) on Autonomous Driving team, focusing 3D reconstruction and generative AI on 3D. In addition, I had multiple summer internship at [SenseTime Inc](https://www.sensetime.com/en) where I worked on NeRF and Autonomous Driving.

My past research experiences focused on both 3D/4D Vision and task excution for autonomou systems. My research goal is to enable robots and autonomous systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the world intelligently to accomplish complex tasks. This lead to my future research interests include but are not limited to: (1) developing learning-based methods for robots task execution, navigation, and (2) improving 3D perception for robotics and high-level scene understanding in real-world environments.



Beyond Research
======
Beyond research, I am the co-founder of **SkyFlow Robotics**, a startup developing **autonomous drone and robotic platforms** for precision agriculture and turf management. My work integrates fundamental AI methods with applied robotics, with the goal of creating systems that are scientifically rigorous, socially impactful, and practically deployable.

Fun Fact
======
I enjoy spending time with my boy Kuma, a playful **Alaskan Malamute** who is turning two years old.
