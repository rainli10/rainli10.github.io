Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Robotics Engineering. I am currently conducting my undergraduate thesis research in long-horizon Vision-Language Navigation under Professor Professor [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander) in [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab (TRAIL)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/). Previously, I worked as student researcher at [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) with Professor [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) on Sparse-view 4D Gaussian Splatting. I also completed a 12-month co-op as Researcher at [Noah's Ark Lab Canada](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) on Autonomous Driving team, focusing 3D reconstruction and generative AI on 3D. In addition, I had multiple summer internships at [SenseTime Inc](https://www.sensetime.com/en) where I worked on NeRF and benchmarking Autonomous Driving algorithms.




Research Interests
======
My past research experiences focused on both 3D/4D Vision and task excution for autonomous systems. My research goal is to enable robots/autonomous systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the world intelligently. This lead to my future research interests include but are not limited to: (1) developing learning-based methods for robots task execution, navigation, and (2) improving 3D perception for robotics and high-level scene understanding in real-world environments.
