Outside academics, I enjoy playing with Soccer, cars, Games, Stocks --- in that order.

I love soccer and once served as the captain of my secondary school team in China. After Grade 9, my knee forced me to give up my dream of playing soccer and I shifted my focus to academics. I’m also a super fan of Henan Football Club, my hometown club. I first went to watch matches at the home stadium with my dad back in 2006, and to this day, every time I go back home, I make sure to visit the stadium to catch a game. Talking about my dream in soccer field? I hope that one day China national football team will qualify for the World Cup :(

For video games, I mainly play CS:GO (CS2). I used to play in UofT JVM in the NACE Starleague North America. Since I couldn’t fully achieve my soccer dream in real life, I channel that passion through the game FIFA (EA Sports FC). At my peak, I ranked 28th in the world ranking in a single-season leaderboard (Division Rivals).

I’ve also been an active stock investor for a long time, since 2013 (I was 12, yes), I started learning about and trading stocks under my mom’s influence, and I’ve continued ever since (mainly in China’s A-share: Shanghai Index, Shenzhen Index)
