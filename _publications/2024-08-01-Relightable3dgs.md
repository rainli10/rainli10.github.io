excerpt: 'Standard 3DGS fails under inconsistent illumination, I contributed to the research work on enabling reconstruction under various lighting conditions. This work was developed based on Relightable 3DGS work and upgrated by incorporating physical lighting models, BRDF decomposition, and material-segmentation priors for guidance of lighting estimation. Our method extends attribute of each gaussian point with local and global light attributes. When optimizing the model, this decouples local light incidents and global incidents. The model enables  geometry optimization shared across lighting conditions while optimizing the global illumination environment. The result PSNR and other metrics got improved and this work integrated into group''s work in autonomous driving reconstruction pipeline.'
