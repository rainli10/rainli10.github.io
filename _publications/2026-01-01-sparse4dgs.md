excerpt: 'Developed a sparse view 4D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm for use in real-world robot tasks. Conducted real-world experiments that demonstrated improved geometric and photometric quality, along with stronger temporal adaptability, validating the system’s effectiveness beyond simulation. The algorithm cuts the number of input views needed for reconstruction from ∼20 to ∼4. This work will be integrated into the group’s adversarial study on iterative-policy-learning.'
